Helvi's PDF Export engine is built for reliability and high-fidelity rendering. By utilizing a server-side Puppeteer instance, we guarantee that what you see in the editor is exactly what you get in your PDF.

## Multi-Template System

Manage multiple brand styles from a single dashboard. Each template supports custom HTML and CSS for complete control.

<Info>
  The PDF engine automatically resolves dynamic variables like `{{title}}`, `{{author}}`, and `{{date}}` in your headers and footers.
</Info>

### Professional Templates

You can create templates for different purposes: Internal Reports, Client Proposals, or Public Documentation.

<CodeGroup>
```css Corporate.css
/* Professional corporate styling */
.tiptap-content h1 {
  color: #1e293b;
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  border-bottom: 2px solid #4f46e5;
  padding-bottom: 1rem;
}

.tiptap-content p {
  line-height: 1.8;
  color: #334155;
}
```

```css Creative.css
/* More vibrant, creative styling */
.tiptap-content h1 {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #6366f1 0%, #a855f7 100%);
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
  font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Gradient Cover Pages

Make a stunning first impression with dynamic gradient cover pages.

<Tip>
  Set the `gradientKey` in your template settings to use one of Helvi's signature gradients like **Midnight Elite** or **Subtle Zen**.
</Tip>

### Stability & Performance

Our engine is hardened for production use:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Zero-Crash Process Isolation" icon="shield-halved">
    Every PDF generation runs in an isolated Puppeteer process. If a rendering task fails, it is automatically cleaned up without affecting the main application.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Concurrency Limits" icon="gauge-high">
    To prevent resource exhaustion, Helvi limits concurrent PDF exports to **2 per instance**, using an intelligent semaphore queue.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hard Cleanup Policy" icon="trash-can">
    A 5-second force-kill timeout ensures no "zombie" browser processes are left hanging in memory.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  In Docker environments, ensure your container has adequate memory (min. 2GB) to handle Puppeteer's rendering overhead.
