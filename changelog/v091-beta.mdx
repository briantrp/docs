## Release Notes - February 23, 2026

We've pushed a critical update to the Helvi Enterprise Platform, focusing on security, high-fidelity exports, and infrastructure stability.

### 🛡️ Security Patch: Nanoid Upgrade
- **Vulnerability Fix**: Upgraded `nanoid` to `v5.1.6` to address critical security advisories.
- **Transitive Safety**: Implemented `overrides` in `package.json` to ensure even nested dependencies like `@excalidraw/excalidraw` and `postcss` use the secure version.

### 📄 Premium PDF Template Engine (Phase L)
- **"Midnight Elite" Design**: A new high-end whitepaper style for all document exports.
- **Full-Bleed Cover**: Edge-to-edge gradients on the first page via CSS `@page` margin rules.
- **Smart Headers & Footers**: Automatic suppression of UI elements on the cover page while maintaining them on all content pages.
- **Typography**: Integration of the **Outfit** Google Font and premium architectural decorations.

### 🛠️ Build & Infrastructure Stability
- **Next.js Prerendering Fix**: Successfully resolved the `useSearchParams()` bailout by wrapping the dashboard in a global `<Suspense>` boundary.
- **Admin Dashboard Reliability**: Applied `force-dynamic` to all admin routes to ensure production consistency.
- **Version Bump**: Official transition to **v0.9.1-beta**.
